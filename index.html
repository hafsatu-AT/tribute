            <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known for the equation E = mcÂ², which expresses the equivalence of energy and mass.</p>
            <p>Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He later became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1940. Over the course of his career, he made groundbreaking contributions to quantum mechanics, the photoelectric effect, and cosmology, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>
